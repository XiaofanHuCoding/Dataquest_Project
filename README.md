## Project Details
### 1. App Store
  - This is a guided project from Data Scientist in Python path, step 1, Python for Data Science: Fundamentals.
  - The source of the data was from statista.com. It contains app data from Apple store and Google play.
  - The goal of this project to collect and analyze data about mobile apps available on App store and Google play.
  - The following questions were answered after this project:
  1) Come up with at least one app profile recommendation for Apple store.
  2) Come up with at least one app profile recommendation for Google play.

### 2. Hacker News
  - This is a guided project from Data Scientist in Python path, step 1, Python for Data Science: Intermediate.
  - Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.
  - The following questions were answered after this project:
  1) Which hours should you create a post during to have a higher chance of receiving comments?

### 3. Ebay Used Car Sale
  - This is a guided project from Data Scientist in Python path, step 2, Pandas and NumPy Fundamentals.
  - The aim of this project is to clean the data and analyze the included used car listings.

### 4. American Community Survey
  - This is a guided project from Data Scientist in Python path, step 2, Exploratory Data Visualization.
  - The dataset was originally from American Community Survey, then FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it on their Github repo.
  - The purpose of the guided project is to practice data Visualization in Matplotlib. The plots used in this project includes: scatter plot, histogram plot, scatter matrix plot, bar plot, box plot, and hexagonal plot.
  - The following questions were answered after this project:
    1) Do students in more popular majors make more money?
    2) Do students that majored in subjects that were majority female make more money?
    3) Is there any link between the number of full-time employees and median salary?
    4) What percent of majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female?
    5) What's the most common median salary range?

### 5. Gender Gap in College Degree
  - This is a guided project from Data Scientist in Python path, step 2, Storytelling Through Data Visualization.
  - The dataset was from The Department of Education Statistics. It contains the percentage of bachelor's degrees granted to women from 1970 to 2012. The data set is broken up into 17 categories of degrees, with each column as a separate category.
  Randal Olson, a data scientist at University of Pennsylvania, has cleaned the data set and made it available on his personal website.
  - In this project, we'll focus more directly on customizing colors, line widths, layout, and annotations to improve the ability for a viewer to extract insights from the charts.
  - In the last step of this project, we'll export the final diagram we create as an image file.

### 6. Employee Exit Surveys
  - This is a guided project from Data Scientist in Python path, step 2, Data Cleaning and Analysis.
  - In this guided project, I'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. The TAFE exit survey data can be found from Australia government website. (https://data.gov.au/)
  - Haven't started this project

### 7. Laptop Prices
- This is a guided project from Data Engineer in Python path, step 2, Algorithm Complexity.
- The goal of this project is to build fast queries on a csv. Thus, the owner of the database can quickly access the information he/she needs. After this project, the owner is able to do the following things faster:
  1) Access laptop information by type laptop ID.
  2) Output all the laptops under a certain price (inclusive).

### 8. Analyzing NYC High School Data
- This is a guided project from Data Scientist in Python path, step 2, Data Cleaning Project Walkthrough.
- The goal of this project is to learn to clean a dataset which is very complex.
- Started the project, but haven't finished it.
