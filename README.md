### 4. American Community Survey
  - It is a guided project from Data Scientist in Python path, step 2, Exploratory Data Visualization.
  - The dataset was originally from American Community Survey, then FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it on their Github repo.
  - The purpose of the guided project is to practice data Visualization in Matplotlib. The plots used in this project includes: scatter plot, histogram plot, scatter matrix plot, bar plot, box plot, and hexagonal plot.
  - The following questions were answered after this project:
    1) Do students in more popular majors make more money?
    2) Do students that majored in subjects that were majority female make more money?
    3) Is there any link between the number of full-time employees and median salary?
    4) What percent of majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female?
    5) What's the most common median salary range?

### 5. Gender Gap in College Degree
  - It is a guided project from Data Scientist in Python path, step 3, Storytelling Through Data Visualization.
  - The dataset was from The Department of Education Statistics. It contains the percentage of bachelor's degrees granted to women from 1970 to 2012. The data set is broken up into 17 categories of degrees, with each column as a separate category.
  Randal Olson, a data scientist at University of Pennsylvania, has cleaned the data set and made it available on his personal website.
  - In this project, we'll focus more directly on customizing colors, line widths, layout, and annotations to improve the ability for a viewer to extract insights from the charts.
  - In the last step of this project, we'll export the final diagram we create as an image file.
